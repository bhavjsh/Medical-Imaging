Brain Tumor MRI Detection

## Overview
This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** to detect whether an MRI scan of the brain shows a **Tumor** or **No Tumor**.  
It demonstrates all key steps dataset preparation, training, testing, and visualization using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

---

## Objective
To build an image classification model that can automatically identify brain tumors from MRI images and support early diagnosis.

---

## Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle – Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)  
**Classes:** Tumor / No Tumor  
**Total Images:** 253 (80% training, 20% validation)
